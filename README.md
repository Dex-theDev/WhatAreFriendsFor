<h1 align='center'> What Are Friends For?</h2>

Need some advice? The What Are Friends For app is here to help! It's really simple, the user simply enters a one word topic, and some personalized advice will appear.

<h2 align='center'> How It's Made</h2>
<h3>Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT</h3>

<p>I used the Advice Slip API interface to fetch data for the kind of advice the app generates. I used an event listener on the button, and coded the javascript  to display the appropriate message to the user upon the click event. I also took some inspiration from Dribble.com for UI components, to make the application more appealing to the eye. </p>

<h2 align='center'> Optimizations</h2>
<p>While I haven't yet deduced the processing speed for this application, I would like to implement best practices for efficiency. There are some code blocks that can use some refractoring. I'd also like to create a stylish error modal that indicates to the user that their topic of choice could not be found. Maybe some gifs in relation to the subject would also look pretty neat!</p>

<h2 align='center'> What I've Learned</h2>
<p>For this project I wanted to get my hands wet with async/await in Javascript. I am already familiar with Promises, but I wanted to take it further and immerse myself in more modern syntax, to keep my code more readable and organized.
